            <p>Hi, I'm Mauricio, I'm 18 years old and I'm in the first semester of Computer Engineering Technology (Status: Alive). 
                I'm from Venezuela, so I speak Spanish, but I can't speak French. 
                I like walking, going to the gym, drawing, playing video games, watching movies and listening to music. 
                I don't really have much experience in web development since I started about a year ago, 
                but I do know the basics of it so I can do things but I usually have to refresh my memory since sometimes 
                I forget something or other.(I don't know how to center divs).I have a fundamental knowledge in what would be html and css, 
                but I never finished learning javascript to use it in webdev.

                <p>Video games are interactive digital games that come in all sorts of colors and flavors. 
                    Lately I'm playing a lot one called Monster Hunter World where you hunt creatures like a dragon that 
                    feeds on other dragons as well as many other creatures with their own personality, 
                    which measures 70 times your size with 1 of 14 different weapons 
                    that have a completely different style of play which make each player unique, 
                    BUT the most important thing is that you can have a cat companion that you can name 
                    and put armor, no doubt peak, attached photo reference.
